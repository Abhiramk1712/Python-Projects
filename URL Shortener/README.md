-> A URL shortener is a tool that takes a long URL and turns it into a short one that redirects to the intended page. URL shorteners prove to be useful in many cases, such as tracking the number of clicks or requiring the user to only type a small number of characters, as long URLs are difficult to memorize.

-> In this tutorial, we will be using Bitly and Cuttly APIs to shorten URLs automatically in Python. Feel free to jump to your favorite provider:
