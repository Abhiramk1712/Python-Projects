-> Web Scraping is one of the skills that every data science professional should know. Sometimes the data we need is available on a website in the form of a table which cannot be downloaded directly from the website. To use that data for any data science task, we need to collect it from the website using web scraping techniques.
-> How are Datasets Created by Scraping the Web?
There are so many libraries, frameworks, and tools that are used for the task of web scraping. Some of the most common libraries and modules in Python used for web scraping are:

- Scrapy
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup
- Urlib.request
All of the above Python libraries and modules are great for scraping data from websites. After scraping the data, the data is prepared so that it can be stored in a CSV file to create a dataset.
