1. Detecting questions means identifying whether a sentence is interrogative or not.

2. We can also use machine learning to detect questions.

3. To write a Python program to detect whether a sentence is a question or not, we first need to create a list of words that we see at the start of an interrogative sentence. 

Examples:-  
            
            what is your name? 

            where do you live?

In these two questions, “what” and “where” are the types of words we need to store in a python list.

4. Next step is to check if a sentence is a question or not, we need to check if any word from the list is present at the beginning of the sentence.

5. If present, then the sentence is a question and vice versa.
